Git is an open-source version control system.
Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire code base and history is available on each developer's machine, making it easy to branch and merge. It also allows developers to see what has been done and revert to a previous phase if they choose to undo some of the changes they made. 

Advantages of Git:

 :Free and open source
 
 :Fast and small.
 
 :Implicit backup
 
 :Security
