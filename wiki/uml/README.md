### StarUML

Star UML is an open source modeling tool which is compatible with UML 2.x versions. It enables you to create a UML diagram quickly and easily without prior knowledge and offers a code generator for all known programming languages by means of an open source extension. In addition, you can use this tool to export the created files as PDF, which is usually essential for the presentation of university assignments. The diagrams can also be published as HTML docs. A great advantage of this software are the numerous extensions that are offered free of charge. The free version hardly restricted me during my test period, I was able to create a UML diagram and save it without a problem.

### Lucidchart

Lucidchart is a diagram tool that also includes a UML tool that can be used online in a browser. To use Lucidchart you need a free account. The difference between the premium version is that you have a larger cloud storage with the premium account. Furthermore, some functions are only available for the premium account, whereby all basic functions are also available for the free account. However, it should be noted that you can only design up to 60 objects in a diagram; more would require a premium account.

Nevertheless, Lucidchart enables easy editing and a user-friendly user interface and a sufficient selection of UML tools. There is also a "sharing" function and simultaneous editing in a team is also possible. Exporting and importing files are also possible and integration in Google Drive or Microsoft accounts or other applications. Office can be integrated with Lucidchart.
