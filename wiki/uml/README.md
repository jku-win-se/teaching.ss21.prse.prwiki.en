### StarUML

Star UML is an open source modeling tool which is compatible with UML 2.x versions. It enables you to create a UML diagram quickly and easily without prior knowledge and offers a code generator for all known programming languages by means of an open source extension. In addition, you can use this tool to export the created files as PDF, which is usually essential for the presentation of university assignments. The diagrams can also be published as HTML docs. A great advantage of this software are the numerous extensions that are offered free of charge. The free version hardly restricted me during my test period, I was able to create a UML diagram and save it without a problem.
